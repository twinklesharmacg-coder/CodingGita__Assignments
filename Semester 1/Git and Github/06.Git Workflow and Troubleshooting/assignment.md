### Assignment 1: Complete End-to-End Practice Task

**Objective:** Perform the full basic Git workflow independently (from creating a file to pushing it to GitHub).

---

#### Tasks:

1. Open (or create) your Day 5 practice repository.
2. Create a file named `practice.txt`.
3. Inside the file, write:
   - Your full name
   - One Git command you learned today
   - One sentence explaining why `git commit` is different from `git push`
4. Run the complete workflow step by step:

```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Added practice file"
git log --oneline
git remote -v
git push origin main
```

5. Verify on GitHub that:
   - The file `practice.txt` is present
   - The commit message **“Added practice file”** is visible

---

#### Submission Requirements:

Submit the following:

1. **GitHub repository link** (the file `practice.txt` must be visible on the `main` branch).
2. **Screenshot of your terminal** showing the output of:
   - `git status` (before and/or after commit)
   - `git log --oneline`
   - Successful `git push`
3. **Screenshot of the GitHub repository** showing:
   - The file `practice.txt`
   - The commit message “Added practice file”

**Note:** Make sure your repository is public (or accessible to the mentor) so the submission can be verified.
